At present this is tested with mosquitto 1.0.3 and 1.0.5 (and 1.1 rev 50b640542a24)
To quite quickly start loading up the CPU usage of a mosquitto broker

  PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
 4763  4730 mosquitt S     4148  14%  38% mosquitto -c mosquitto.nobridge.conf
 4766  4724 root     S     4696  16%  29% /tmp/simplemq 15


$ ./simplemq 15

mosquitto is running with the following config...

blah.conf: (nothing else, all defaults)
log_dest syslog
log_dest topic

CPU usage of the mosquitto process (and this process) will steadily increase over time, and the message rate
simplemq reaches will slowly decrease, and the loop time will slowly increase.

Comments in code refer to "local" and "bridging" but even with bridging config removed, problem persists
There are no subscribers at all, but if you use mosquitto_sub -t "#" -d, you see that the qos2 messages
arrive very very sporadically, like so... ( qos2 publishes to local/dev-%d, qos0 publishes to power/)
