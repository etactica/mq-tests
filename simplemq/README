NOTE: the problem seen here has been fixed in current versions of mosquitto.
It was also never a problem for anyone using the threaded client library api.

This code is only preserved as it can be a useful tool for generating large amounts of mismatched qos
traffic.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At present this is tested with mosquitto 1.0.3 and 1.0.5 (and 1.1 rev 50b640542a24)
To quite quickly start loading up the CPU usage of a mosquitto broker

  PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
 4763  4730 mosquitt S     4148  14%  38% mosquitto -c mosquitto.nobridge.conf
 4766  4724 root     S     4696  16%  29% /tmp/simplemq 15


$ ./simplemq 15

mosquitto is running with the following config...

blah.conf: (nothing else, all defaults)
log_dest syslog
log_dest topic

CPU usage of the mosquitto process (and this process) will steadily increase over time, and the message rate
simplemq reaches will slowly decrease, and the loop time will slowly increase.

Changing the qos on line 76 to be 15 qos2 messages to every qos0 message results in the logs in this
directory.

Adding the "mosquitto_message_retry_set(state.mosq, 600);" line of code prevents the broker CPU
usage from rising over time, but the client CPU usage still rises over time.
