Output from mosquitto_sub -t "#" -h test.server.ip

Things to note:
* local/dev-2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,15 are almost never seen.
* despite publishing 15:1 more local than power messages, we see more like 1:3
* We see some very very old messages.  power/ messages were close enough to real
  time, local/ messages were slowly falling behind, with occasioanal very old
  packets coming through. (marked XX)
* every single qos0 packet is received, most of the qos2 packets are missing.
  (the batch number should increment by two for each power message)
